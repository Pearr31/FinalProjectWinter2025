# Food Ordering System (Java)

## Overview
This Java-based Food Ordering System allows users to browse and order food online. Customers can choose between Takeout (pickup, no delivery fees) or Delivery (driver assigned, extra fee). Menu items are loaded from a file using File I/O. The system includes an Admin portal for managing menu items, discount codes, and processing orders. Drivers can log in to accept delivery orders, mark them as delivered, or cancel accepted orders.
